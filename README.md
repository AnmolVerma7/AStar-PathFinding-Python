# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

## Description
This Python script, `astar.py`, provides a visual implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Pygame. It's designed to visually demonstrate the most efficient path between two points in a 50x50 grid. The script allows users to interact with the grid, place start and end points, and visualize the pathfinding process in real time.

## Installation
To run this script, you'll need Python and Pygame. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it via pip: `pip install pygame`

## Usage
Run the script with the following command: `python astar.py`

Once the window opens, you can interact with the grid to set start and end points, as well as obstacles, and then watch the A* algorithm in action.

## Controls
- **Left Mouse Click**: Set the start point, end point, and draw obstacles.
- **Right Mouse Click**: Remove nodes or obstacles.
- **Spacebar**: Start the algorithm.
- **C**: Clear the grid.
